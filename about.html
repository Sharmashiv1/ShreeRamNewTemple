                        <p>The Ramayana is an ancient Indian epic, composed some time in the 5th century BCE, about the
                            exile and then return of Rama, prince of Ayodhya. It was composed in Sanskrit by the sage
                            Valmiki. who taught it to Rama's sons, the twins Lava and Kush. At about 24000 verses, it is
                            a rather long poem and, by tradition, is known as the Adi Kavya (adi = original, first;
                            kavya = poem). While the basic story is about palace politics and battles with demon tribes,
                            the narrative is interspersed with philosophy, ethics, and notes on duty. While in that
                            other Indian epic, the Mahabharata, the characters are presented with all their human
                            follies and failings, the Ramayana leans more towards an ideal state of things: Rama is the
                            ideal son and king, Sita the ideal wife, Hanuman the ideal devotee, Lakshman and Bharat the
                            ideal brothers, and even Ravana, the demon villian, is not entirely despicable.

                            Dasharath, king of Ayodhya, had no children. So he arranged a Putra-kameshti sacrifice
                            (putra = son, kameshti = that which is desired). At the sacrifice, Agni (god of fire) arose
                            from the flames and handed the king a golden vase brimming with nectar. "Give this to your
                            queens", said the god and disappeared. The king had three wives. To the eldest, the king
                            gave half of the nectar; the second queen got a portion that remained when the queen had
                            drunk her half. To the youngest queen, the king gave the remaining half of the nectar and
                            again, the second queen got the portion that remained. In time, the queens gave birth to
                            sons: to the eldest was born Rama, to the youngest was born Bharat, and to the second queen
                            were born the twins Lakshman and Shatrughna.

                            When the princes had grown up some, the sage Vishwamitra arrived at Dasharath's court and
                            asked that Rama and Lakshman be "lent" to him to help him rid his hermitage of the demons
                            that were plaguing the ashram dwellers by defiling their sacrifices with blood and bones,
                            and by killing them off. After the two princes successfully rid the ashram of the demons,
                            the sage took them to the neighbouring kingdom of Mithila to show them the swayamvar
                            festivities of the Mithila princess, Sita, born of the earth. The king of that country had
                            adopted Sita as his daughter and, after Sita had grown up, had declared that he would give
                            her in marriage to anyone who could string the Great Bow of Shiva. No one could. Several
                            kings, princes, and commoners had tried and failed.
                            The swayamvar had been in progress for several months now and the bow still remained
                            unstrung. It was to this place that the sage Vishwamitra brought the two princes of Ayodhya.
                            Rama and Lakshamn entered the assembly hall where the bow was displayed in all its glory.
                            Rama walked over, picked up the bow, strung it, and plucked the bowstring with such a twang
                            that two things happened simultaneously: the twang was heard for miles around, and the force
                            of it broke the bow into two with so great a sound that the king and his courtiers came
                            running from their chambers to see what the commotion was about. When the confusion had
                            settled, Rama was married to Sita. His three brothers were married to a sister and cousins
                            of Sita, and there were many festivities and much rejoicing in the two kingdoms.

                            Some time later, Dasharath decided he had grown too old to rule and declared he would
                            abdicate in favour of Rama, the eldest born and the crown prince. This is when his youngest
                            queen invoked an old promise that Dasharath had made to her: she demanded that Rama be
                            exiled for 14 years and that her own son, Bharat, be crowned king. Dasharath refused but
                            Rama decided to honour his father's old promise and left for the forests. He was accompanied
                            by Sita and by Lakshman, both of whom could not be dissuaded from following him. In grief at
                            the injustice of it all and at Rama's departure, Dasharath died within two days.
                            Bharat was not in Ayodhya when these events happened; he, and the fourth prince Shatrughna,
                            were away holidaying at Bharat's maternal grandfather's country. They were summoned to
                            Ayodhya in haste and, when Bharat learnt what had happened, he was furious. He shouted at
                            his mother, refused to ascend the throne, and gathered the townsfolk around him to proceed
                            to the forest and bring Rama back.
                            Rama refused to return, stating his intention to serve his father's last wish by being an
                            exile for the full 14 years. Bharat returned with Rama's sandals, placed them on the throne,
                            and proceeded to rule the country in Rama's name. Meanwhile, Rama moved further south even
                            deeper into the forests so that the people of Ayodhya would not find it easy to keep coming
                            to his hut and begging him to return.

                        <p>One day, a demoness named Surpanakha saw Rama and, being charmed out of her wits by his
                            beauty, walked up to him and begged him to marry her. "I already have a wife", said Rama and
                            pointed to Sita. "Why don't you marry my brother Lakshman instead?" When Surpanakha turned
                            towards Lakshman, he declared he'd taken a temporary vow of celibacy and sent her back to
                            Rama. What followed was that the brothers took turns to thus play ping-pong with her and
                            when Surpanakha, by now angry beyond measure, rushed towards Sita to kill her, Lakshmana cut
                            off Surpanakha's nose and ears.
                            Surpanakha flew towards Lanka (modern Sri Lanka), ruled by her brother Ravana, and
                            complained. Enraged, Ravana vowed vengeance. He persuaded the demon Marich to disguise
                            himself as a golden deer and wander near Rama's hut. When Sita saw the golden deer, she
                            begged Rama to get it for her. When the brothers were out pursuing the deer, Ravana arrived,
                            abducted Sita, placed her in his flying chariot, and flew through the skies to Lanka. When
                            the princes, after having killed the golden deer and discovered it was a demon in disguise,
                            returned to their hut, they found it empty and started to look for Sita.

                                    During their wanderings, the princes came upon a group of monkeys who showed them
                                    some
                                    ornaments of Sita's: the monkeys had seen a beautiful lady crying and dropping her
                                    ornaments from a chariot in the sky that was being driven southwards by a demon.

                                    Among the monkeys was Hanuman, who ultimately located Sita's whereabouts to be in
                                    Ravana's kingdom in Lanka. Rama gained the help of the monkey chief Sugreeva,
                                    gathered a
                                    monkey army, marched southwards, built a bridge across the ocean and crossed over to
                                    Lanka. Rama, after an epic battle, was then able to kill Ravana and finally free

                                    Since the 14 years were over by now, Rama then returned to Ayodhya, was crowned
                                    king, and ruled the kingdom with great wisdom: no child died before their
                                    parents
                                    did, no door needed locks against robbers, no farmland lay barren, no tree went
                                    fruitless, and there was peace and prosperity all around.

                                    The Ramayana, as composed by Valmiki, is thought to have six chapters and to
                                    end
                                    at this happy point. A seventh chapter, called the Uttar-Ramayana (uttar =
                                    post,
                                    after, that which comes later) continues the story and ends on a slightly
                                    less
                                    happy note. This is how the story continues: After many months of Rama's
                                    rule,
                                    rumours began to surface among the populace regarding Sita's chastity since
                                    she
                                    had been abducted and imprisoned by a demon. Mindful of the feelings of his
                                    subjects, Rama asked Sita to undergo an Agni Pareeskha again. Sita refused,
                                    whereupon Rama banished her. Lakshman was deputed to escort her out of the
                                    kingdom; he did so unwillingly and left Sita near the hermitage of Valmiki.

                            <p>Sita was pregnant at that time. Valmiki took her in as an ashram inmate,
                                and
                                she gave birth to her twins there: sons named Lava and Kush whom Valmiki
                                brought up with great love and affection, teaching them princely skills
                                such
                                as archery as well as scholarly skills such as the Vedas and other
                                scriptures. Valmiki also taught them to sing the Ramayana, which he had
                                finished composing by this time. The twins, who were unaware of their
                                parentage and, hence, unaware that they were singing about their own
                                family,
                                would recite the poem at gatherings. They became so well-loved for their
                                sweet recitation that their fame reached Rama's ears who summoned them
                                for a
                                performance. It was here at Rama's court that the true story was
                                revealed to
                                the twins: that they, spitting images of the king, were his sons and
                                that
                                their mother was none other than the Sita whom they sang of Rama, in
                                remorse, asked Sita to return to the palace if she could prove her
                                chastity
                                again before an assembly. Sita, in anguish, cried out, "O mother earth,
                                just
                                take me away from this place forever!" Whereupon the ground parted, the
                                goddess Prithivi arose on a golden throne, took Sita in her lap,
                                descended,
                                and the rift closed. Sita was forever lost. Griefstricken, Rama decided
                                to
                                live no longer. He abdicated the throne in favour of his sons and, along
                                with his brothers, entered the waters of the river Sarayu that skirted
                                Ayodhya; their spirits left their bodies and ascended to the heavens.

                            <p>The Ramayana was composed in Sanskrit. Over the years of re-tellings,
                                several
                                vernacular versions emerged that embellished the story, added regional
                                touches, and inserted explanations and justifications for those bits
                                that
                                showed the hero, Rama, in a not-too-heroic light. The Ramavataram,
                                composed
                                by the Tamil poet Kamban in the 12th century CE, is popular in the
                                southern
                                parts of India. In the north, the Ramacharit Manas, composed by the
                                Awadhi
                                poet Tulsidas, is extremely popular. Other variations exist in Bengali,
                                Malayalam, Telegu, Kannada, and other Indian languages.

                                The Ramayana's characters have found their way into the common speech
                                and
                                idiom of the land. Public recitations of the Ramayana are common. The
                                epic
                                has been adapted into plays and films; it is also enacted every year by
                                local troupes and neighbourhood societies in North India during the
                                Dusshera
                                festivities of the present times. Scenes from the epic can be seen on
                                the
                                walls of some of the oldest temples across Asia.

                                Rama is worshipped as an incarnation of god Vishnu, and it is not
                                uncommon
                                to find a Rama temple in almost every other neighbourhood in the country
                                in
                                the northern parts of India, especially in the Gangetic belt. In
                                countries
                                of South-East Asia, such as Cambodia, Indonesia, and Malaysia, the story
                                of
                                Rama continues to be told through intricately crafted shadow puppet
